Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeevanmerkaji/KauSchlau.git
cd react_native-restate
```

**Installation** 

```bash
npm install
```

**Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following content:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_GALLERIES_COLLECTION_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_REVIEWS_COLLECTION_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_AGENTS_COLLECTION_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROPERTIES_COLLECTION_ID=
```

Replace the values with your actual Appwrite credentials. You can obtain these credentials by signing up & creating a new project on the [Appwrite website](https://apwr.dev/JSM050).

**Start the app**
   
```bash
 npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
